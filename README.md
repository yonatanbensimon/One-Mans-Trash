# One Man's Trash

One Manâ€™s Trash is an endless runner game, where the player, Florida Johnson, runs through a temple as a boulder is chasing her. She carries a flashlight to see obstacles ahead of her to avoid and can pickup items via left-click. Taking lost items outlined in green provides a speed boost, while taking cursed treasure (outlined in red) or crashing into an obstacle will slow her down. If she slows down too much, she will be run over by the boulder, causing a game over. The tempo and pitch of the music matches her speed, and the screen shakes when the boulder is right behind her. You can tell where the boulder is relative to her by the bar at the top of the screen.

One Man's Trash was developed over 48 hours in a team of five people during the McGill Game Jam. The team was composed of the following people:

- Yonatan Bensimon (Game Designer)
- Marc-Antoine Feriaux (Graphic Designer)
- Conor Geoghegan (Graphic Designer)
- Aidan Marcelissen (Sound Designer)
- Brandon Toledano (Game Designer)

An executable of the game is available in this repository or through the game's itch.io webpage (https://yon03.itch.io/one-mans-trash)
